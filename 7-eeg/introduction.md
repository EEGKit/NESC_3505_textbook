# Introduction to EEG

EEG, or *electroencephalography* (which combines the words for "electric", "head", and "picture"), is a noninvasive neuroimaging technique that is widely used in cognitive neuroscience research, and in clinical neurology. It measures electrical activity from the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp. In this chapter, we will learn the basics of EEG, including its neurological basis, and how to process and analyze the data.
